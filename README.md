# WurstGlide
Detect and block Wurst's Glide hack!

# Description
***WurstGlide* by BsnNick**


WurstGlide was a short project by me to block Wurst's Glide mod. Tested it with myself and one person with much higher latency (US vs. EU) and had positive results.

WurstGlide effectively blocks and warns staff (wurstglide.staff) of violators. When WurstGlide detects someone using Wurst's Glide mod (and possibly other 'hacked' clients, as well), it will alert staff members of the violator and set a downwards velocity on the player (versus cancelling, so people who accidently trigger WurstGlide shouldn't be affected too much).

**Give the permission node *wurstglide.staff* to players you want to be alerted when someone triggers WurstGlide.** Please note that this plugin tends to be spammy, so giving it to all players (essentially a broadcast) is not a very good idea.

Note:
- There are currently no plans to expand this plugin - I will only fix bugs and make general improvements.
- Older versions of Spigot and WurstGlide may not be supported.
